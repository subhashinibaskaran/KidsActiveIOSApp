# KidsActiveIOSApp
This is an IOS app created in swift. This app lists all the activities available for kids in the GTA. Active API, a free API available online has been used for this app. The API call returns a JSON. This JSON has been extracted to display the required fields. The activities are divided into different categories and the user of the app can choose the category from the Initial List. The main storyboard has been uploaded for an easier illustration. Tableviews are used for displaying the activities under a category. CollectionViews are used to display the results to the users according to the activity selected.

This is the main story board of the app
